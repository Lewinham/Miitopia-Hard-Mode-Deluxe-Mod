##### Version 1.0
##### By Lewinham
##### For 3DS Only

An even harder version of AbdyyEee's [Miitopia But Harder](https://github.com/AbdyyEee/Miitopia-But-Harder) mod that offers a new and improved gameplay experience. (Download instructions also included in this link.)

## Features
 - Improved teammate AI
 - Even stronger enemies with new mechanics
 - More challenging enemy spawns
 - Lesser impact of RNG on gameplay.
 
###### One of the biggest problems with the original Miitopia is the prevalence of RNG, resulting in an often frustrating gameplay experience. By improving the teammate AI and changing some enemy mechanics, RNG becomes less problematic. This combined with the stronger enemies increases room for strategizing, making the game much more fun as a turn-based RPG. If played correctly, the main story can be beaten without grinding.
